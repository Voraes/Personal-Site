# Crafting the Perfect Terminal for Coding Bliss

Hey! If you're like me, you probably spend a ridiculous amount of time staring at your terminal. Itâ€™s basically home base, right? So why not make it look and feel amazing? Let me walk you through how I customized my terminal to be not just functional but also ridiculously cool with tools like Zsh, Tmux, and Starship.

## Step 1: Picking the Right Shell 

Alright, first things first ditch the default shell (usually Bash) and switch to Zsh. Why? Because Zsh is like Bash on steroids. Itâ€™s faster, more customizable, and has a ton of plugins thatâ€™ll save you time and headaches.

Hereâ€™s how to get started:

1. Install Zsh: On most systems, itâ€™s as simple as running `sudo apt install zsh` (Linux) or `brew install zsh` (Mac).
2. Make it your default shell: Run `chsh -s $(which zsh)`.
3. Grab Oh My Zsh: This is a must have. Itâ€™s a framework that makes customizing Zsh a breeze. Install it with:
   ```bash
   sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
   ```
4. Explore themes and plugins: My favorites are the `z` plugin for quickly jumping between directories and the `git` plugin for, well, git stuff.

## Step 2: Multiplex Like a Pro with Tmux

Next up, Tmux. If youâ€™re not already using it, youâ€™re missing out. Tmux lets you split your terminal into multiple panes, keep sessions running in the background, and reconnect to them later. Itâ€™s like magic.

Hereâ€™s my typical setup:

1. Install Tmux: `sudo apt install tmux` or `brew install tmux`.
2. Customize your `.tmux.conf`: This is where the magic happens. Hereâ€™s an example:
   ```bash
   set -g mouse on
   bind-key -n C-h select-pane -L
   bind-key -n C-l select-pane -R
   bind-key -n C-j select-pane -D
   bind-key -n C-k select-pane -U
   ```
   This enables mouse support and sets up some handy key bindings.
3. Pro tip: Pair Tmux with Tmuxinator if you want to create pre configured project workspaces. Itâ€™ll save you so much time.

## Step 3: Adding Some Style with Starship

Now, letâ€™s talk about Starship the prompt thatâ€™ll make your terminal pop. Starship is lightweight, insanely fast, and ridiculously easy to set up. Plus, it looks awesome.

Hereâ€™s how I set it up:

1. Install Starship:
   ```bash
   curl -sS https://starship.rs/install.sh | sh
   ```
2. Add it to your shell config (e.g., `~/.zshrc`):
   ```bash
   eval "$(starship init zsh)"
   ```
3. Customize it: The `~/.config/starship.toml` file is where you can tweak the look and feel. Hereâ€™s an example(more in https://starship.rs/presets/):
   ```toml
   [prompt]
   add_newline = false
   [rust]
   symbol = "ðŸ¦€ "
   [git_status]
   show_sync_count = true
   ```

## Bonus Tips for Terminal Bliss

- **Font matters:** Use a nerd font for those fancy icons. My go to is FiraCode Nerd Font.
- **Colors:** Pick a terminal theme that doesnâ€™t burn your eyes after 12 hours. Iâ€™m partial to Solarized Dark and Dracula.
- **Tools to explore:** Check out fzf (fuzzy finder), bat (better cat), and exa (better ls). Theyâ€™re game changers.

## Wrapping It Up

Customizing your terminal isnâ€™t just about aestheticsâ€”itâ€™s about making your workspace feel like your own. Plus, every time someone glances over and sees your slick setup, youâ€™ll get those sweet, sweet nods of approval.

So, what are you waiting for? Dive in, tinker around, and make your terminal something you actually enjoy looking at. Trust me, itâ€™s worth it.

Happy coding!
